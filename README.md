# Solutions to "The C programming language" exercises

This project contains my solution of the exercises from the book
'The C Programming Language (second edition)' by Kernighan and Ritchie.

Note: The solutions try to keep track of what theory has been provided
before the exercise is issued in the book.
Some solutions may benefit from a switch statement for example, but if
the switch statement has not yet been taught, it is not used in the solution.

It may be a good exercise to revisit the solutions after you consumed the
complete book.
